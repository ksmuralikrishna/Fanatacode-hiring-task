Hiring Task: Login & Dashboard Mini Project
Objective:
Build a simple login and dashboard project to demonstrate your knowledge of .NET backend and Angular frontend development.
Project Requirements:
1. Login Page:
        - A page with username and password fields.
        - On successful login, redirect the user to the dashboard page.
        - Display a basic error message for invalid login.
2. Dashboard Page:
        - After login, display a chart (e.g., bar or pie chart) using any charting library.
        - The chart should use hardcoded data (e.g., ticket count by status or sales data).
3. Backend Guidelines:
        1. Build APIs using .NET Core.
        2. Implement a distributed rate-limiting mechanism for the login API to prevent brute force attacks.
        3. Return an authentication token after logging in and validate it in protected API calls.
4. Submission Guidelines:
        1. Upload the project to your GitHub and share the link.
        2. Inc lude setup instructions in a README file.
        3. Keep the project simple and focused.
